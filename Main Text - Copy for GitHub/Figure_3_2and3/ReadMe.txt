Here are the steps to reproduce Figures 3.2 and 3.3.

1. The MATLAB script "ATongue_brute_force.m" generates the data for plotting.
	- NOTE: this script takes many, many hours to run
	- the data is output in the text file "AtongueMatrix2.txt"

2. Once the text file from step 1 is generated, run the MATLAB script "Plot_ATongue.m" to generate Figures 3.2 and 3.3.
