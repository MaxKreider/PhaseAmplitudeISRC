Steps to produce Figure 4.3 (important - must complete steps in the order listed)

1. Run the scripts "K_function_osc_1.m" and "K_function_osc_2.m" to generate the K functions for oscillators 1 and 2.
   - output: (a) plots of the K functions
	     (b) .mat files containing the K function data (up to order 15)

2. Run the scripts "ResponseCurves_osc_1.m" and "ResponseCurves_osc_2.m" to generate the PRC and IRC for oscillators 1 and 2.
   - output: (a) plots of the PRC and IRC functions
	     (b) .mat files containing the PRC and IRC data (up to order 8)

3. Run the script "Plot.m" to produce the plots in Figure 4.3 
   - output: (a) plots in Figure 4.3
	     (b) L2 error measure E_delta
