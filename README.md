On the Relation Between Infinitesimal Shape Response Curves and Phase-Amplitude Reduction for Single and Coupled Limit-Cycle Oscillators

This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the figures in the manuscript "On the Relation Between Infinitesimal Shape Response Curves and Phase-Amplitude Reduction for Single and Coupled Limit-Cycle Oscillators" by Kreider and Thomas (SIADS, 2024).

All code is written and functional for MATLAB R2021a. One may need to install various MATLAB toolboxes for the code to run; MATLAB should give a prompt to download the appropriate toolbox, if necessary.

To reproduce a figure in the manuscript, navigate either to the "Main Text" or "Appendix D" folder, and then select the folder corresponding to the desired figure. A read-me text is available for each figure, as it may be necessary to run certain scripts in a specific order.
